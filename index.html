    <h1>The Process</h1>

    <h2>Privilege Deodorant Spray for Men</h2>
        <p>I decided to pull five players from a painting of basketball players for the main theme and I used images of basketball players playing basketball and people cheering for the background. I added an audio clip of people cheering and another audio clip of an upbeat soundtrack to complete the project.</p>

        <p>Applications: Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator</p>
        
    <h2>Pepperidge Farm “Just My Imagination”</h2>
    
        <p>Using images that I found on the internet I decided on an image of a rooster and another image of a dairy cow. I wanted to show the cow enjoying a snack of milk and cookies. The idea was to have the milk and cookies disappear with the cow acting non-cholent as if he has no idea what happen to the milk and cookies… I added a milk mustache on the cow, a barnyard sound clip and a country music audio clip to complete the project.</p>

    <h2>Folgers Coffeehouse Blend “Coffee Time”</h2>
        
        <p>For this project I decided to create several animated coffee cups dancing and spinning around with a video in the background of people drinking and enjoying Folgers Coffee. At the end of the video I wanted to show one of the animated coffee cup also drinking a cup of coffee.</p>
